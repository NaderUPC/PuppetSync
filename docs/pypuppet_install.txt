DEPENDANCY: PyYAML --> pip3 install --upgrade pyyaml



The module defaults to using an unauthenticated SSL connection.
You may want to create and use a client SSL key/certificate signed by the Puppet CA.
On the puppet master (with root privileges):

    puppet cert generate api

Replace api with another certname if desired.

This will generate $vardir/ssl/private_keys/api.pem and $vardir/ssl/certs/api.pem, 
which should be moved or otherwise made accessible to the user and host using pypuppet, if necessary.
On Debian, $vardir defaults to /var/lib/puppet.



[!] To allow access to the REST API, the puppet master auth.conf file needs to be changed.
